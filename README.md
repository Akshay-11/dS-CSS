#Behind the Idea ?
To build a website we have to learn html,css,javascript,jquery,bootstrap just to give attractivness to the website . If we make a css file which has already written css for every code needed in website and is also fully responsive , what can be so easier than this . Why to pay for websites if you can build your own by just giving some 2-3 hours learning ds-css .
