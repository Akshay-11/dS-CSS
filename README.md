# dS-CSS: The CSS framework you'll ever need

A *modern*, *fully-responsive*, *lightweight* CSS framework to make websites in no time!

![dS-CSS Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anirudhkhanna/dS-CSS/master/logo-ds.png)

It already contains all the necessary CSS, so you don't need to mess with styling the elements in your website - just use DS-CSS and focus on the content. It removes the difficulty of switching repeatedly between HTML and CSS files.  Contains all commonly used functionalities like **animations**, **carousels** etc. It saves your time while creating a website and is normalized - so no cross browser bugs!

A simple example showing how to style a button using DS-CSS: `<button class="ds-button ds-sea-green ds-text-white ds-padding-xlarge">Explore Now</button>`


## How to use?
You can download the CSS file (http://ds-css.16mb.com/css/ds.css) or just include this code in your HTML to use DS-CSS directly:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://ds-css.16mb.com/css/ds.css" />
```

With 80+ colors in our library, responsive layout elements, large number of preset animations, you just need to write their names in your HTML code. Example: `<p class="animate-fade">Feeling fuzzy!</p>`. The fade-in animation will automatically apply on the paragraph.


## Why so special?
* Easiest to use and learn
* Saves time
* You don't have to worry too much about styles and responsive layout - just focus on your content
* Fully responsive
* Normalized - no cross-browser issues
* Beautiful and aesthetic styles


## Behind the idea
To build a website, we have to focus extensively on CSS styling just to ensure that the site is attractive the layout is unbreakable. So why not use a CSS file which already has beautifully coded CSS classes for every element needed to build a website? What more - it is also fully responsive!
